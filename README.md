# ‚ÅâÔ∏è What is this?

This is a modpack that attempts to give a perfect "pick up and play" experience for Minecraft. No unnecessary long load times, no bloat, no obstructions, just a perfect and charming experience for controller and keyboard players alike.

Additionally, it is a blend of modern day Java Minecraft and Legacy Edition Minecraft. Applied with the classic textures, alongside maintaining the standard Java feel (with some cool cosmetic and quality of life mods), this modpack is designed to give you the best mix of Java and Legacy Edition.

_*Cow not included. Distant Horizons is, though!_

# üéÆ Controller support?

Yes! Thanks to [MidnightControls](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightcontrols), you can play with any controller you desire. Even touchscreen is supported!! If you prefer keyboard, don't worry, nothing's changed.

# üñ•Ô∏è Client-side?

This modpack is **only** client-side, meaning servers do not have to have it installed! Just download this pack through your favourite launcher, and you're set.

# üèÜ How is this modpack any better than the other console edition ones?

It ain't. They do a legacy console replication much better than this one, but this modpack isn't aiming for that. It's actually the only one out there that gives a nice mix of both legacy console and modern Minecraft, rather than aiming for a replication of pure legacy console or pure Bedrock Edition.
